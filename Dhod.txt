More in depth: 
History: Dhod was once a vast and powerful nation, its Dragonborns ruling over large territories. However, repeated wars—primarily with Kud and its allies—have led to Dhod’s gradual decline, both in terms of land and influence.
Current State: As Dhod’s borders have shrunk, many Dragonborn have been forced out of their ancestral lands. The remaining population faces significant oppression, especially near the border with Kud, where the elves have begun forcefully displacing Dragonborn communities.
Culture: Despite their struggles, Dhod’s Silver Dragonborn hold on to their traditions of honor and martial prowess. Their diminishing state fuels a growing desire among many for a resurgence, though they are wary of provoking an all-out war with Kud.
Tensions with Kud: The oppression of the Dragonborn by Kud has only deepened the divide between the two nations. Kud’s strategy is seen by many as a calculated effort to erase the Dragonborn presence from their former lands, stoking resentment and unrest within Dhod.
