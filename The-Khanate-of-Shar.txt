The Khanate of Shar

Geography:
- **Location**: The Khanate of Shar is a rugged, mountainous kingdom dominated by Mountain Dwarves, renowned for their expertise in mining, metallurgy, and stonework. The kingdom is nestled within a formidable range of towering mountains that provide natural fortifications and abundant mineral resources. Beneath the earth, the dwarves have carved out intricate cities within the mountains, crafting vast halls adorned with precious gems and metals.
- **Climate**: Shar’s landscape is mostly made up of towering, snow-capped peaks, deep valleys, and underground cities that span miles. The kingdom thrives on the rich deposits of iron, gold, and mithril found deep within the mountains. The passes and valleys are fortified with immense stone gates, making Shar one of the most defensible regions in the world.
- **Neighbors**: The Khanate borders the Thearchy of Kilnarg to the southeast and the archipelago of the Kingdom of Zraz to the northwest. The relationship with Zraz is cooperative, but there are ongoing tensions with the Elven Alliance.

Culture:
- **Dwarven Society**: Dwarven society in Shar is hierarchical, ruled by a **Khan** who is chosen based on merit, often from among the greatest warriors, miners, or craftsmen. The Khan leads a council of elders and clan leaders, ensuring that tradition, trade, and defense are all maintained in balance. Festivals often celebrate the founding of great cities or mining achievements, with contests of strength, skill in forging, and drinking being central to these celebrations.
- **Warrior Culture**: Shar dwarves have a strong warrior culture, honed by the harsh environment and the necessity of defending their mountain fortresses from external threats. Their proximity to the Thearchy of Kilnarg, a neighboring Aarakocra state, and the tensions with the remnants of the Elven Alliance, keep the dwarves ever vigilant.

Political Stance:
- **Neutrality in Conflicts**: While Shar has maintained neutrality in most conflicts, the kingdom's relationship with its neighbors is complex. The dwarves of Shar share a deep-rooted disdain for the elven kingdoms, especially since Zraz left the Elven Alliance following the Second Dragonborn War due to their treatment of the Dragonborn. However, Shar is more focused on protecting its borders and sustaining its mining operations than engaging in external politics.
- **Diplomatic Relations**: 
   - Shar maintains trade with Zraz and other nations when it benefits them. However, they harbor suspicions toward the remaining Elven Alliance members, particularly **Kud**, seeing them as potential threats to the independence and resources of their kingdom.
   - Shar’s diplomatic ties with the **Thearchy of Kilnarg** are mostly peaceful, though occasionally strained due to territorial disputes over the mountainous borders. The two nations have a mutual respect for each other’s ability to thrive in harsh environments, though the sharp contrast between the militaristic dwarves and the religious, theocratic Aarakocra makes for an interesting dynamic.

Conclusion:
The Khanate of Shar is a proud and resilient kingdom, characterized by its mastery of the mountains and the arts of war and craftsmanship. Their deep connection to the land and their strategic position make them a formidable force in the region. While they avoid unnecessary involvement in the politics of their neighbors, Shar remains a critical player in maintaining the balance of power in the region.
